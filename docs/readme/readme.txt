About
-----

Playfield Engine is a lightweight game scripting runtime.  With scripts
written in Playfield Script, it can render graphics and play sounds across
multiple platforms.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned power user, you can create games on
your PC — just like coding in classic BASIC, but with modern features.

Installation
------------

Just extract the ZIP file to any folder of your choice.

Usage (Windows)
---------------

Double-click "playfield.exe".
If a "main.pf" file exists in the same folder, it will run automatically.

You can also bundle your assets (scripts, images, sounds, fonts, etc.) into a
single package file.  Select the files and drag & drop them onto
"playfield-pack.exe" — this will generate an "aassets.pa" file.

Usage (macOS)
-------------

Open "playfield.dmg" and copy the "Playfield.app" to any folder.  Place the
app in the same folder as "main.pf" or "assets.pak", then double-click the
app to run it.

Usage (Wasm)
------------

Upload the generated "assets.pak" and "index.html" to a web server.
To preview the game locally, use "playfield-web.exe".

Usage (iOS)
-----------

Place "assets.pak" in the "misc/ios/Resources/" folder, then open the project in Xcode.

Usage (Android)
---------------

  - Copy all assets into "misc/android/app/src/main/assets".
  - Open the "misc/android" folder with Android Studio
  - Build the project
  - Run the app on your device or emulators

Usage (Unity)
-------------

Copy all assets into the "misc/unity/Assets/StreamingAssets" folder,  
then open the project "misc/unity" in the Unity Editor.

Playfield Script Syntax
=======================

`Playfield Engine` uses `Noct` as a scripting language.

## Assignments

Variables in Noct are dynamically typed and don't require explicit
declaration. The assignment operator (`=`) is used to create and
assign values to variables.

As shown in the example below, Noct supports various data types
including integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. Variables can
be reassigned to different types at any time during execution.

```
func main() {
    var a = 123;
    print(a);

    var b = 1.0;
    print(b);

    var c = "string";
    print(c);
}
```

## Global Variables

Global variables can be defined in functions, and cannot be defined
outside functions.

```
func main() {
    globalVariable = 123;
    print(globalVariable);
}
```

## Local Variables

Using the `var` keyword allows you to declare a variable as
local. Without `var` declaration, assigning to a variable may create a
global variable.

```
func main() {
    var a = 123;
    print(a);
}
```

## Array

Arrays are ordered collections of values, accessed by index. Arrays
support iteration through the `for` loop construct, allowing you to
iterate through each value directly.

```
func main() {
    var array = [0, 1, 2];
    for (value in array) {
        print(value);
    }
}
```

Arrays can hold values of different types simultaneously, reflecting
the dynamic typing system.

```
func main() {
    var array = [123, "string"];
}
```

The language provides a built-in function `push()` to add elements to
the end of an array.  Also, `pop()` removes the final element.

```
func main() {
    var array = []
    array->push(0);
    array->push(1);
    array->push(2);

    var last = array->pop();

    print("Length = " + array.length);
}
```

## Dictionary

Dictionaries store key-value pairs, similar to hash maps or objects in
other languages. They are defined using curly braces with key-value
pairs separated by colons. Dictionaries support iteration where both
the key and value can be accessed simultaneously.

```
func main() {
    var dict = {key1: "value1", key2: "value2"};
    for (key, value in dict) {
        print("key = " + key);
        print("value = " + value);
    }

    print("Length = " + dict.length);
}
```

Dictionaries may be constructed in a single step way. An assignment
can be an array style which uses `[]`, or an object style which uses
`.`.

```
func main() {
    var dict = {};
    dict["key1"] = "value1";
    dict.key2 = "value2";
}
```

The built-in function `remove()` allows for the deletion of entries by
key.

```
func main() {
    var dict = {key1: "value1", key2: "value2"};
    remove(dict, "key1");
}
```

## For-loop

The for-loop construct provides a concise syntax for iterating through
sequences such as ranges, arrays, and dictionaries.

The range syntax (using the `..` operator) creates an iterator that
generates values from the start to one less than the end value.

```
func main() {
    for (i in 0..10) {
        print(i);
    }
}
```

For-loops can also iterate directly over arrays and other collection
types.

Arrays can be iterated by the for-value syntax.

```
func main() {
    array = [0, 1, 2];
    for (value in array) {
        print(value);
    }
}
```

Dictionaries can be iterated by the for-key-value syntax.

```
func main() {
    var dict = {key1: "value1", key2: "value2"};
    for (key, value in dict) {
        print(key + "=" + value);
    }
}
```

## While Loops

The while-loop provides a traditional iteration mechanism that
continues execution as long as a specified condition remains
true. Unlike for-loops which are designed for iterating over
collections, while-loops are more flexible and can be used for
implementing various algorithms where the number of iterations isn't
known in advance. The example shows a basic counter implementation
incrementing from 0 to 9.

```
func main() {
    var i = 0;
    while (i < 10) {
        print(i);
        i = i + 1;
    }
}
```

## If and Else Blocks

Control flows allow for conditional executions based on evaluated
expressions. The if-else construct follows a familiar syntax where
conditions are evaluated in sequence.

```
func main() {
    var a = readint();
    if (a == 0) {
        print("0");
    } else if (a == 1) {
        print("1");
    } else {
        print("other");
    }
}
```

## Lambda Functions

Functions are first-class objects in the language. Anonymous
functions, also known as `lambda` expressions, allow you to create
functions without names.

```
func main() {
    var f = (a, b) => { return a + b; }
    print(f(1, 2));
}
```

Lambda functions are simply translated to named functions in the
compilation process. Therefore, they can't capture variables declared
in outer functions.

## Increment/Decrement (+=, -=, ++, --)

```
func main() {
    var a = 123;
    a += 321;
    a++;

    var b = 123;
    b -= 321;
    b--;
}
```

`++` and `--` are supported only as standalone statements (`a++;`, `b--;`).
Using them inside expressions is disallowed to avoid complex side-effects.

## OOP in Noct

The object-oriented model in Noct is a lightweight variation of prototype-based OOP.

- Classes are simply dictionary templates
- Inheritance and instantiation are realized by dictionary merging
- There is no prototype chain, and modifying a class does not affect existing instances

This design treats dictionaries as first-class objects, and the author refers to it as Dictionary-based OOP (D-OOP).

```
func main() {
    // The base class definition. (A class is just a dictionary.)
    Animal = class {
        name: "Animal",
        cry: (this) => {
        }
    };

    // The subclass definition. (Just a dictionary merging.)
    Cat = extend Animal {
        name: "Cat",
        voice: "meow",
        cry: (this) => {
            print(this.name + " cries like " + this.voice);
        }
    };

    // Instantiation. (Just a dictionary merging.)
    var myCat = new Cat {
        voice: "neee"
    };

    // This-call uses -> () syntax. (Equal to myCat.cry(myCat))
    myCat->cry();
}
```

## Intrinsics

### int()

```
var i = int(1.23);
```

### float()

```
var f = float(123);
```

### newArray()

```
var array = newArray(10);
```

### push()

```
var array = [1, 2, 3];
array->push(4);
```

### pop()

```
var array = [1, 2, 3];
var last = array->pop();
```

### resize()

```
var array = [1, 2, 3];
array->resize(2);
```

### substring()

```
var s1 = "ABCDEFG";
var s2 = s1.substring(1, -1); // from the char 1, to the end "BCDEFG"
}
```

### charAt()

```
var s = "ABC";
for (i in 0 .. s.length) {
   var c = s->charAt(i);
   print(c);
}
```

### sin(), cos(), tan()

```
var s = sin(x);
var c = cos(x);
var t = tan(x);
```

### abs()

```
var a = abs(x);
```

### random()

```
var r = random(); // 0 .. 1.0
```

### fast_gc(), full_gc(), compact_gc()

```
// Do young GC.
fast_gc();

// Do young + old GC.
full_gc();

// Do young + old + compact GC.
compact_gc();
```

### unset()

```
var dic = {key1: "ABC"};
dic->unset("key1");
```

Playfield Script API
====================

Every API function takes one parameter. The parameter must be a dictionary and
arguments must be stored as key-and-value pairs.

## Skelton

```
func setup() {
    return {
        width:  1920,
        height: 1080,
        title:  "My Game"
    };
}

func start() {
    playerTex = Engine.loadTexture({
                    file: "player.png"
                });
}

func frame() {
    Engine.draw({
        texture: playerTex,
        x:       Engine.mousePosX,
        y:       Engine.mousePosY
    });
}
```

## Debug

### debug()

This API prints a string or dumps an object.
Only this API takes a non-dictionary argument.

```
func dumpEnemies() {
    if (Engine.isGamepadXPressed) {
        debug("[Current emenies]");
        debug(enemies);
    }
}
```

```
func frame() {
    var dt = (Engine.millisec - lastTime) * 0.001;

    update(dt);
    render();
}
```

### Engine.getDate()

                    Copyright 1996-2023
              by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg


Introduction
============

The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the
FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which
do not fall under their own explicit license.  The license affects
thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and
makefiles, at the very least.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally
distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and
Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
beta or final release.

`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.
This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType
engine'.

This license applies to all files distributed in the original
FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file itself.


1. No Warranty
--------------

THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


2. Redistribution
-----------------

This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,
display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense
the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and
derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others
to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the
following conditions:

  o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file
    (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to
    the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
    documentation.  The copyright notices of the unaltered, original
    files must be preserved in all copies of source files.

  o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that
    states that the software is based in part on the work of the
    FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.  We also
    encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your
    documentation, though this isn't mandatory.


3. Advertising
--------------

Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the
name of the other in any publicity or advertising without prior
written consent.

We suggest, but do not require, that you acknowledge the use of
FreeType in your documentation, for example by saying

   "Portions of this software are copyright © 2019 The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved."

Please replace the year with the value from the copyright notice
found in each file.
