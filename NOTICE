FreeType2

                    The FreeType Project LICENSE
                    ----------------------------

                            2006-Jan-27

                    Copyright 1996-2023
              by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg


Introduction
============

The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the
FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which
do not fall under their own explicit license.  The license affects
thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and
makefiles, at the very least.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally
distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and
Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
beta or final release.

`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.
This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType
engine'.

This license applies to all files distributed in the original
FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file itself.


1. No Warranty
--------------

THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


2. Redistribution
-----------------

This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,
display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense
the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and
derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others
to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the
following conditions:

  o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file
    (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to
    the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
    documentation.  The copyright notices of the unaltered, original
    files must be preserved in all copies of source files.

  o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that
    states that the software is based in part on the work of the
    FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.  We also
    encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your
    documentation, though this isn't mandatory.


3. Advertising
--------------

Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the
name of the other in any publicity or advertising without prior
written consent.

We suggest, but do not require, that you acknowledge the use of
FreeType in your documentation, for example by saying

   "Portions of this software are copyright © 2019 The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved."

Please replace the year with the value from the copyright notice
found in each file.

Legal Terms -- Final Words
